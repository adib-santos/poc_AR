## Objective 
To enable the general public to understand the heart journey of those who have decided to join the German army through a 20 min documentary via the companion of mobile web AR experience. This is also a part of the freetech project that aims to bring together journalists and digital pioneers to create the future of journalism together.

## How WebAR can be used in journalism/ documentary production? 
Some of the use cases we think of that makes AR applicable in relevant to journalism is that it could provide in-depth information about the person being interviewed / complex topic that is discussed. 

it can also incorporate sharable content into the experience.

## Remarks on marker-based scanning 
It is important to note that for markers to work properly in documentary, the center has to be color #F0F0F0, while outside has to be black, outlined by a white border ( >4px width). In order to avoid scanning confusion, it is important to note that not use similar symbols in the center. For example if one marker is 'AR', the other marker shouldn't be 'AR2'.

## Tech stack 
powered by [Aframe](https://aframe.io/).

## Challenges encountered on the way 
The most challenging part of this project is the testing part, ensuring it works on all devices and all browsers. At the moment, the framework for testing AFrame is still very limited. We utilized [this framework](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/tests) to compose our unit tests. [This](https://aframe.io/docs/1.3.0/introduction/models.html#testing-for-performance) also offers some good insights into how to unit test the models.

## Testing 
For end-to-end test, [this](https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/aframe-e2e-testing) is a good starting point once end-to-end tests are requied. 
## What's next 
After this project phase, for the team that is hoping to take up this project, the next steps would be looking to : 
1. Look into how this can be scaled up on national TV level
2. Infrastructure requirements to make the AR experience smooth. 

## Our Journey of collaboration
You might wonder, how do developers and journalists actually collaborate? To share our journey, we have created this [video]()

## Accessibility 
We also take into the account and consider the accessibility of this product. We want this product to be as inclusive as possible. We also encourage the people who will be carrying this project forward would consider how people of disabilities or minorities experience this product? 
## Deployment Options
As a team, we have evaluated and investigated different deployment options, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gw72x8VcZdBaXSfdBey-huKr_AmJcjgAUHnXnaMBCVo/edit?usp=sharing). But we would recommend Combell, which has a lot of experiences hosting AR experiences.
