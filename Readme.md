## How WebAR can be used in journalism/ documentary production? 
Some of the use cases we think of that makes AR applicable in relevant to journalism is that it could provide in-depth information about the person being interviewed / complex topic that is discussed. 

it can also incorporate sharable content into the experience.

## Remarks on marker-based scanning 
It is important to note that for markers to work properly in documentary, the center has to be color #F0F0F0, while outside has to be black, outlined by a white border ( >4px width). In order to avoid scanning confusion, it is important to note that not use similar symbols in the center. For example if one marker is 'AR', the other marker shouldn't be 'AR2'.

## What's next 
After this project phase, for the team that is hoping to take up this project, the next steps would be looking to : 
1. Look into how this can be scaled up on national TV level
2. Infrastructure requirements to make the AR experience smooth. 
## Deployment Options
As a team, we have evaluated and investigated different deployment options, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gw72x8VcZdBaXSfdBey-huKr_AmJcjgAUHnXnaMBCVo/edit?usp=sharing). But we would recommend Combell, which has a lot of experiences hosting AR experiences.
